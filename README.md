# Project Title

The website uses firebase to store the train details inputted in the form section of the bottom part of the page. The first train time must be entered in Military time in the format shown in the parantheses. The page also uses moment.js to get the time as of the last refresh so the data will remain static until refreshed.

## Getting Started

Simply add in the details for the train you would like to add using the form at the bottom of the page. Refresh the page for up to date data. You will not have to reenter the train after refreshing.
